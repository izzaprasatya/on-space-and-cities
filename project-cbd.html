            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Since my return to this country exactly six months ago, there has been one city to the west of my home that I frequently visit: South Tangerang.
                The frequency of my visits to this city is driven by matters of the heart, which time and again compel reason to submit. And throughout my journeys
                toward and through this city, there are many things I have observed—far too many, in fact, to be fully described here. One aspect that is perhaps
                sufficiently spatial in nature is the concentration of activities within this city. This city possesses numerous activity centers, yet I am deeply
                curious as to which of these centers are truly local in character, and which exhibit high levels of commercial activity, superior accessibility,
                and a high concentration of office functions. The latter may also be referred to as a Central Business District (CBD).
            </p>
            <p>
                This study aims to provide an overview of the CBD area in South Tangerang. Does South Tangerang have a single high-order activity center? Or does it,
                in fact, have more than one? This is done by delineating CBD areas in South Tangerang. The study employs a data-driven spatial analysis approach, with
                various parameters taken into account, such as the density of Points of Interest (POI) related to high-order activities, building density, road network
                accessibility, and intersection density. Of course, this is also complemented by meaningful field observations, which I carried out while riding through
                the streets of this city.
            </p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                Penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan multi-kriteria dengan beberapa tahapan analisis:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Spatial Filtering:</strong> This is applied to POI and road data, because only certain categories are required for this study. For POI data, categories such as banks,
                hospitals, universities, colleges, malls, and department stores are the main characteristics of a CBD. Meanwhile, for road data, only arterial roads and primary roads are used.
            <p>
                <strong>2. POI Weighting:</strong> Using the logic that high-order functions = higher weight, which is also linear with central place theory, weights are assigned to each POI based
                on its high-order functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. Kernel Density Estimation:</strong> Estimation is carried out using weighted POI data, with a radius of 800 m. The 800 m radius is chosen because the characteristic of a
                CBD is pedestrian accessibility, where people can normally walk within an 800 m threshold.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. Building-form Intensity:</strong> Using building data, neighborhood density is calculated through focal statistics to examine floor-area concentration and vertical/horizontal
                urban intensity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>5. Accessibility Analysis:</strong> For the filtered road data, intersection density analysis is conducted to observe the density of road intersections. After that, Kernel Density
                Estimation is applied for interpretative purposes, based on the logic that high intersection density = high route choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>6. Data Normalization:</strong> POI data, building density, and accessibility density are converted into raster format and then normalized using the formula
                ("raster@1" − minimum("raster@1")) / (maximum("raster@1") − minimum("raster@1")).
            </p>
             <p>
                <strong>7. Spatial Weighting:</strong> Following the normalization process, the three datasets are integrated using a weighted linear combination. The weights are assigned based on their relative importance, as defined in the following equation:
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>CBD Index</em> = (0.4 × α) + (0.35 × β) + (0.25 × γ)
            </p>
            <p>
                where:
                <br>α = Normalized Point of Interest (POI) density
                <br>β = Normalized building density
                <br>γ = Normalized accessibility index
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>8. CBD Delineation:</strong> The result of the CBD Index displays areas with high-order activity at varying intensity levels. In this study, areas with the highest activity levels
                are of particular interest, as these are the areas that tend to exhibit CBD characteristics. The delineation of these areas is the final stage of this analysis.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>
                Actually, when my curiosity about the CBD in this city reached its peak, I formulated the following hypothesis: South Tangerang essentially has CBD in its self-contained new towns developed by
                Alam Sutera, Bintaro Jaya, and Bumi Serpong Damai. The characteristic of these new towns is that each possesses its own CBD, although the definition of a CBD that they construct does not
                always align with classical Urban Geography literature. Indeed, the results of the CBD delineation in this study are located within these three new towns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike the classical definition of a CBD, South Tangerang seems to “break” the classic CBD model. As can be seen on the map below, the CBDs in South Tangerang are dominated by modern
                shop-houses and a limited number of high-rise buildings that can be counted on one’s fingers. In the 1950s, a geographer or planner would most likely have considered this not to be a
                characteristic of a CBD, which traditionally required a dominance of economic activities housed in tall, multi-story buildings. However, every city is unique, and the passage of time also
                produces contextual answers appropriate to its era. Although in form it does not follow the conventional morphological characteristics of a CBD, it still exhibits a dominance of mixed
                retail + office + services + finance activities that serve wide catchment areas (not locally in nature), operate for extended hours, have high transaction intensity per unit area, and function
                as the functional equivalents of CBD blocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, the CBDs in South Tangerang do receive academic support when referring to several well-known Urban Geography theories, such as those of Burgess, Hoyt, and Harris–Ullman,
                which define the CBD functionally rather than morphologically.

            <h2>Implications & Recommendations</h2>
            <p>
                The results of this CBD delineation are highly beneficial for urban planning. The identification of CBD areas has proved useful in establishing more appropriate zoning regulations,
                including building height restrictions, floor area ratios, and land-use designation.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the field of transportation, these CBD areas can be further analyzed if, in the future, transit-oriented development (TOD) zones are to be developed here (where, according to the CBD
                delineation in this study, almost all CBDs in South Tangerang are car-oriented, requiring private vehicles as the main mode of access to these areas. This is highly unsustainable and
                not livable!).
